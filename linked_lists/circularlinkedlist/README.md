#Circular Linked List

Basic Idea: The tail (the last node) is connected to the head (the first node)

Advantages: 
1. We can traverse the whole list from any node
2. Implementation of algorithms like round robin becomes easier
3. We can insert at the beginning and end by just maintaining one tail reference

Disadvantages:
1. Implementation of Code becomes complex
